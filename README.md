# Bubble Sort Visualizer
This program provides a clear and understandable visual representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm utilizing the Python Pygame Library. Users can determine the number of elements to be sorted, as well as the fps in which they are sorted. 

## Instructions

**1. Clone Repository:**  
  git clone https://github.com/aaronnewmanj/Bubble-Sort-Visualizer.git

**2. Run Program:**  
   python3 BubbleSort.py  
   or  
   python BubbleSort.py  

**3. Select number of items and fps:**  
   You will be promted to select the number of elements to be sorted through, and how fast they are sorted through (fps)  

**4. Watch the magic happen:**  
  The program should autimatically generate a set of bars with random heights across the screen (you determined the number of bars).     
  It will them sort through each of the bars using the Bubble Sort algorithm, highlightig each swapped element as it sorts through them.     
  The final product should look like the bars are sorted from shortest to tallest.
